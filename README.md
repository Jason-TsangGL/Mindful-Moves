Software Development Kits and Wearable Devices in Physical Activity Research
This project aims to enhance research methods in physical activity studies by leveraging the capabilities of software development kits (SDKs) and wearable smart devices. The Canadian Guidelines recommend physical activity for overall health benefits, including cognitive, emotional, functional, and physical health. However, traditional research methods are inefficient and outdated.

Background
The paper proposes a new approach for conducting physical activity research, using a generic mobile application transformed into a research-based mobile application. The researchers used three open-source SDKs, namely ResearchKit, CareKit, and HealthKit, to develop the desired application.

Methodology
The researchers identified the research question and goals, then used ResearchKit for informed consent, surveys, and active tasks, CareKit for protocol management, and HealthKit for accessing and sharing health-related data. The application was evaluated by a content expert, and the participant experience was optimized for easy use. The collected health-related data were analyzed to identify any significant findings.

Results
Wearable health devices offer a convenient and non-invasive way to monitor and track health-related information. Using SDKs and wearable devices in physical activity research can enhance research methods and provide valuable insights into overall health benefits.

Conclusion
The paper concludes that leveraging the data provided by wearable devices, researchers can gain insights into the effectiveness of interventions and inform the development of evidence-based physical activity guidelines. By adopting SDKs and wearable devices in physical activity research, researchers can improve their methods, enhance their data collection, and provide more comprehensive insights into overall health benefits.
